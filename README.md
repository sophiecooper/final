wines with the dinner or food that you are currently enjoying.

  and this month with the wine tracker.

* After clicking the button, users will select the meal type(dinner, desert, etc)
* Next, users select the type of food they are eating (meat, spaghetti, etc.)
  as well as an optional sauce choice.
